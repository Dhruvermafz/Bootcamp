      <h1>Aegon II Targeryan</h1>
      <p>
        was the sixth Targaryen king to sit the Iron Throne, succeeding his
        father, Viserys I Targaryen, as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. His ascent
        was disputed by his older half-sister, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who
        had been their father's designated heir. Aegon and Rhaenyra fought for
        the throne in the civil war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons,
        in which both siblings perished.
